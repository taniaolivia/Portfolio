                description: "Viami is my school professional project where me and my partners build a startup from scratch. My team consists of three marketers, one UX/UI designer, one artistic director, and two developers—my partner and me. The objective of this application is creating and developing a mobile application tailored for solo travelers, facilitating the search for companions for joint travel adventures while also providing insights into destination-related activities. To accomplish this, I'm leveraging a range of technical skills, including proficiency in creating APIs using Node.js, MySQL, Knex.js, Express.js, and Docker. Additionally, I'm adept at managing image and video storage on AWS, utilizing services like CloudFront and S3, as well as storing the database on AWS RDS while ensuring robust testing with Jest. Security is paramount, so I'm implementing JWT for API security. On the front-end, I'm crafting user interfaces and the application itself using Flutter for a seamless experience across platforms. To keep our users engaged and informed, I'm integrating Firebase for push notifications on both iOS and Android. Finally, I'm incorporating RevenueCat and in-app payments for streamlined payment management within the application.",

If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, then a player loses a life. During the making of this game, because of the lack of teammates, we couldn’t finish this game 100%.<br><br>There are some functionalities that couldn’t be completed like the level functionality when all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new and harder level. Another one is the special colored bricks functionality, when a player could gain more points from one or two special colored bricks placed randomly between the normal bricks.",
